## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading
- Make sure you selected the `dist` folder (not the root project folder)
- Check that all files are present in the `dist` folder
- Verify the manifest.json is valid

### Chat Icon Not Appearing
- Ensure you're on a Leetcode problem page (URL contains `/problems/`)
- Try refreshing the page
- Check the browser console for any errors

### API Errors
- Verify your OpenAI API key is correct
- Check that you have sufficient API credits
- Ensure the key starts with `sk-`

### Content Script Issues
- Reload the extension in Chrome
- Check that the content script is being injected (look in browser console)
- Try visiting a different Leetcode problem page

## File Structure After Build
